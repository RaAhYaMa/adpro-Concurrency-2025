**Commit 2 Reflection Notes**

As I worked on implementing the `handle_connection` function, I gained a deeper understanding of how to handle incoming TCP connections and serve HTML content. One key takeaway was the importance of specifying the `Content-Length` header in the HTTP response. This header informs the client of the size of the response body, which is crucial for proper rendering of the HTML content.

I also learned about the `BufReader` type and how it can be used to improve performance when reading from a stream. By buffering the data, we can reduce the number of reads from the underlying stream, making the program more efficient.

Another important aspect was understanding how to read and write files using the `fs` module. In this case, we read the contents of the `hello.html` file and serve it as the response body.

To test the program, I made sure to run `cargo run` from the same directory as the `hello.html` file. I also captured a screenshot of the browser rendering the HTML content and added it to the `README.md` file.

Here's a screenshot of the browser rendering the HTML content:

Overall, this exercise helped me understand the basics of handling HTTP connections and serving HTML content in Rust. I'm excited to continue exploring and learning more about web development in Rust.
